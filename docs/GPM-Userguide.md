### GPM Workflow
- Upload Subject and Reference Genomes.
- Run preliminary alignments of each subject Genome to the Reference.
- Run an assembly of each Genome.
- “Clean Up” each Chromosome for the assemblies.
- Fill any possible gaps using alternative assemblies of the same subject.  
- Eliminate any identifiable contamination.  

### GPM Main Interface
![assemblyRun](images/GPM_Screenshots/Slide1.PNG)
> The “General” tab is used to upload and manage genomes.
> The “Assembly” tab is used to create assemblies of contigs and align them to chromosomes.
