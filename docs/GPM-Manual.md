### Visualization of typical available data in GPM
- GPM assemblyCtg view of a 500-KB region
![ctgViewer](images/ctgViewer.png)
`AssemblySeqs, top and bottom, are shown as overlapping (yellow) and fully redundant assemblySeqs are gray. The retained (green) and removed (gray) portions of assemblySeqs are indicated.`

- Chromosome-scale view of a 500-KB region that compares two genome assemblies to a Reference sequence
![chrViewer](images/chrViewer.png)
`The Reference Sequence is shown in the middle (bright green) with alignments (yellow) to each assemblyCtg (violet) at the top and bottom. The assemblyCtg order can be changed by drag-and-drop.`
